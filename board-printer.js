/* 
    Given a tic-tac-toe board represented by an array of arrays - output the board to the terminal.
    For example, if we have the following board:
        board = [
            ['X', '_', '_'],
            ['_', 'X', '_'],
            ['O', 'O', 'X']
        ];
    We should output something like this (feel free to be creative):
          X  |     |     
        =================
             |  X  |     
        =================
          O  |  O  |  X
