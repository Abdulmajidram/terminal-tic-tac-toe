/*
    Given a tic-tac-toe board (an array of arrays), return true if the game is over and false otherwise.
    The game is over if the board has the same value 3 times in a row.
        The values could be in a row, in a column or diagonal.
    If the game is over, print a message to the console saying who has won the game!
    Test your function! An example board where the game is over is:
        let board = [
            ['X', '_', '_'],
            ['_', 'X', '_'],
            ['O', 'O', 'X']
        ];
*/
export function isGameOver(board) {
    return false;
}
